# N-Puzzle-solver-with-Search-Algorithms

N-puzzle solver with Search Algorithms including: BFS, DFS (with limited depth), Greedy and A*


There are 2 heuristics for Greedy and A* algorithms. The first one evaluates states with manhattan distance and the second one evaluates states with number of misplaced tiles.
